#### !! ATTENTION !!
There are currently no plans to upload this to Curse or WoWInterface. If
you would like to have an auto-updater, then I would suggest WoWUp. It supports
downloading from several providers like Curse, WoWInterface, Wago, TukUI and
GitHub. Simply provide the repo's clone address to WoWUp and it will track when
new GitHub Releases are made and trigger an update.

If you wish to contribute, please fork and submit a pull request. I am not very
active in game, but I will give any contributions the same care and attention
you did. Please note, you will need to copy the Libs folder from the most recent
release into your development version since they are not included in the repo.

Any issues, feature requests or suggestions should me made using the issues
here in GitHub.
