# XIV_Databar

#### !! ATTENTION !!
There are currently no plans to upload this to Curse or WoWInterface. If
you would like to have an auto-updater, then I would suggest WoWUp. It supports
downloading from several providers like WoWInterface, Wago, TukUI and
GitHub. Simply provide the repo's clone address to WoWUp and it will track when
new GitHub Releases are made and trigger an update.

If you wish to contribute to the project, please fork and submit a pull request. 
To get a working development copy, simply copy the Libs folder from the
[latest release](https://github.com/Kozoaku/XIV_Databar/releases/latest) into your
cloned repository.

I am not very active in game, but I will give any contributions the same care and 
attention you did. Please note, you will need to copy the Libs folder from the most recent release into your development version since they are not included in the repo.

Any issues, feature requests or suggestions should be made using the issues
here in GitHub.
